# Minimal Version Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Removed Logging System**
- No more log file creation (`MemoryPoolNVSE_RPmalloc.log`)
- `WriteLog()` function converted to no-op
- All logging calls remain in code but do nothing
- Removed file I/O operations and timestamps

### ✅ **Removed Statistics Tracking**
- No allocation counting (`g_allocation_count`)
- No memory usage tracking (`g_total_allocated`, `g_peak_allocated`)
- NVSE script commands now return 0.0 for statistics
- `LogMemoryStatistics()` function disabled

### ✅ **Simplified Hook Functions**
- Removed complex error reporting
- Removed large allocation logging
- Removed memory diagnostics on failure
- Minimal logic - just call rpmalloc and return

### ✅ **Cleaned Debug Output**
- Removed imported DLL listing
- Removed detailed initialization messages  
- Removed memory mapping failure diagnostics
- Removed verbose version checking messages

### ✅ **Removed Jemalloc References**
- Updated documentation files
- Cleaned references from WARP.md and PROJECT_SETUP.md
- Plugin now focuses purely on rpmalloc

### ✅ **Simplified Initialization**
- Minimal memory system initialization
- Reduced message handler complexity
- Streamlined plugin load/unload process
- Silent version checking and fallback

## Size Reduction
- **Before**: 149 KB (full version with logging/statistics)
- **After**: 92.5 KB (minimal version)
- **Reduction**: 56.5 KB (38% smaller)

## What Still Works

### ✅ **Core Functionality**
- rpmalloc initialization and configuration
- TLS optimization (minimal thread data usage)
- Progressive fallback system
- IAT hooking (when available)
- Large Address Aware support

### ✅ **NVSE Integration**
- All 5 NVSE script commands registered
- Plugin query and load functions
- Message handling for initialization/cleanup
- Version checking and compatibility

### ✅ **Safety Features**
- No Windows heap function hooking (crash prevention)
- Safe C runtime targeting only
- Graceful degradation when hooks fail
- Clean plugin shutdown

## NVSE Commands (Modified)

All commands still exist but statistics return 0:
```
IsMemoryPoolActive    -> Returns 1 if active, 0 if not
IsMemoryPoolHooked    -> Returns 1 if hooked, 0 if not  
GetMemoryPoolAllocations -> Returns 0.0 (statistics disabled)
GetMemoryPoolFrees    -> Returns 0.0 (statistics disabled)
GetMemoryPoolUsage    -> Returns 0.0 (statistics disabled)
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Performance**
- Faster startup (no log file creation)
- No I/O overhead during allocations
- Reduced memory footprint
- Minimal CPU overhead

### ✅ **Reliability**
- No file system dependencies
- No logging-related errors
- Simpler code paths
- Reduced complexity

### ✅ **Privacy**
- No allocation pattern logging
- No debug information written to disk
- No system information collection
- Silent operation

## Use Cases

### **Production Environment**
- End users who just want the performance benefits
- No debugging or diagnostic information needed
- Minimal system impact
- Clean, professional plugin behavior

### **Server/Headless Usage**
- No log file creation or management
- Minimal disk I/O
- Reduced attack surface
- Silent operation

### **Performance-Critical Applications**
- Every CPU cycle matters
- Minimal memory overhead
- No I/O blocking during allocations
- Streamlined execution paths

## Installation

Same installation process as before:
1. Copy `MemoryPoolNVSE_RPmalloc.dll` to `Data\NVSE\Plugins\`
2. Launch via NVSE
3. No log file will be created (this is intentional)
4. Test with NVSE commands: `IsMemoryPoolActive`

## Monitoring

Since logging is disabled, monitor plugin status via:
```
; In-game console or script
IsMemoryPoolActive    ; Should return 1 if working
IsMemoryPoolHooked    ; Should return 1 if IAT hooks installed
```

## Technical Notes

- All TLS fixes remain active
- Progressive fallback system still functions
- Safety mechanisms still in place
- Compatible with all previous functionality
- Can be used alongside other NVSE plugins

This minimal version provides the same core rpmalloc benefits with significantly reduced overhead and a cleaner, production-ready approach.
