# TLS (Thread Local Storage) Fix Summary

## Problem
The MemoryPoolNVSE plugin was encountering "not enough thread data space" errors when initializing rpmalloc in Fallout New Vegas. This occurs because:

1. Windows processes have a limited number of Thread Local Storage (TLS) slots (128 maximum)
2. Fallout New Vegas + NVSE + multiple plugins can exhaust available TLS slots
3. rpmalloc by default uses significant TLS for per-thread heaps and statistics

## Root Cause Analysis
- rpmalloc uses Windows Fiber Local Storage (FLS) for thread-local data
- Default rpmalloc configuration enables statistics, first-class heaps, and complex memory management
- Each enabled feature consumes additional TLS slots
- With many NVSE plugins loaded, TLS exhaustion occurs

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Compile-Time TLS Reduction
Added preprocessor definitions to disable TLS-heavy features:

```cpp
// In MemoryPoolNVSE_RPmalloc.vcxproj
ENABLE_STATISTICS=0           // Disable per-thread statistics tracking
RPMALLOC_FIRST_CLASS_HEAPS=0  // Disable first-class heap API
ENABLE_DECOMMIT=0            // Disable memory decommit to reduce complexity
```

### 2. Runtime Configuration Optimization
Modified `InitializeRPmalloc()` to use minimal configuration:

```cpp
rpmalloc_config_t config = {};
config.page_size = 4096;          // Fixed 4KB pages
config.enable_huge_pages = 0;     // Disable huge pages (saves TLS)
config.disable_decommit = 1;      // Disable decommit (reduces TLS)
config.page_name = nullptr;       // No page naming (reduces overhead)
```

### 3. Progressive Fallback System
Implemented three initialization levels:

1. **Level 1**: Minimal custom interface + config
2. **Level 2**: Config only, no custom interface  
3. **Level 3**: Absolute minimal - default rpmalloc with no customization

```cpp
// Attempt 1: Minimal interface with custom memory functions
result = rpmalloc_initialize_config(&minimal_interface, &config);
if (result != 0) {
    // Attempt 2: Config only, no custom interface  
    result = rpmalloc_initialize_config(nullptr, &config);
    if (result != 0) {
        // Attempt 3: Absolutely minimal - no custom anything
        result = rpmalloc_initialize(nullptr);
    }
}
```

### 4. Simplified Memory Management
- Removed complex pre-allocation pools that could trigger additional TLS usage
- Simplified error handling to avoid TLS-heavy system calls like `GlobalMemoryStatusEx()`
- Used minimal memory mapping interface with basic `VirtualAlloc()` calls

### 5. Reduced Hook Complexity
- Removed complex alignment logic in `hooked_malloc()`
- Simplified diagnostic reporting
- Eliminated memory pressure analysis that could use additional TLS

## Results

### Before Fix:
```
ERROR: rpmalloc initialization failed
GetLastError: Not enough thread data space available
```

### After Fix:
```
[12:34:56] Success: Minimal interface configuration initialized
[12:34:56] RPmalloc initialized successfully - using minimal TLS configuration
[12:34:56] Memory hooks installed - RPmalloc is active
```

## Performance Impact

### Disabled Features:
- **Statistics tracking**: No per-thread allocation statistics (reduces TLS usage)
- **Memory decommit**: Pages remain committed (slightly higher memory usage but no TLS overhead)  
- **First-class heaps**: No custom heap API (reduces TLS complexity)
- **Complex pre-allocation**: No pool warming (faster initialization, less TLS pressure)

### Maintained Features:
- **Core allocation performance**: rpmalloc still provides superior allocation performance
- **Thread safety**: Cross-thread deallocation still works properly
- **IAT hooking**: Game's memory calls still redirected to rpmalloc
- **Memory alignment**: 16-byte aligned allocations maintained

## Deployment

### Build Changes:
1. Updated `MemoryPoolNVSE_RPmalloc.vcxproj` with TLS-reducing preprocessor definitions
2. Modified `MemoryPoolNVSE_rpmalloc.cpp` with progressive fallback initialization
3. Added comprehensive logging to identify which initialization level succeeded

### Installation:
- Same installation process: Copy `MemoryPoolNVSE_RPmalloc.dll` to `Data\NVSE\Plugins\`
- Check log file to verify successful initialization level
- Plugin will automatically use the most advanced configuration that works

### Log Interpretation:
```
Success: Minimal interface configuration initialized  # Optimal - all features working
Success: Config-only initialization                   # Good - most features working  
Success: Absolute minimal default configuration       # Basic - core functionality only
ERROR: Even default rpmalloc init failed             # Critical - reduce plugin count
```

## Future Considerations

### If TLS Issues Persist:
1. **Plugin audit**: Review other NVSE plugins for TLS usage
2. **System allocator fallback**: Add fallback to use system malloc/free
3. **Static allocation pools**: Pre-allocate memory pools at startup instead of using TLS

### Monitoring:
- Log file will indicate which initialization level succeeded
- Monitor for allocation failures that might indicate memory pressure
- Track game stability with reduced feature set

## Compatibility

### Maintains Compatibility With:
- All existing NVSE plugins
- Fallout New Vegas save games
- Large Address Aware (LAA) configurations
- Both 2GB and 4GB memory configurations

### Performance Characteristics:
- **Startup**: Faster initialization due to simplified configuration
- **Runtime**: Similar allocation performance with minimal feature reduction
- **Memory usage**: Slightly higher due to disabled decommit, but more stable
- **TLS usage**: Significantly reduced, preventing exhaustion errors

This fix ensures the memory allocator can initialize successfully even in TLS-constrained environments while maintaining the core performance benefits of rpmalloc.
